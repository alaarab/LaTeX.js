features:
- title: 100% JavaScript
  details: LATEX.js is written in 100% JavaScript and runs in the browser. No external dependencies need to be loaded.

- title: CLI
  details: The latex.js binary allows to translate LATEX files in the console.

- title: Compatibility
  details: "LATEX.js produces almost the exact same output you would get with LATEX—except where impossible: glue cannot
    be translated to HTML, and sometimes cannot even be interpreted in the context of HTML."

- title: Extensibility
  details: New macros can easily be added in JavaScript. Very often it is much easier to implement a piece of
    functionality in JavaScript and CSS than it is in LATEX.

- title: Speed
  details: LATEX.js only needs one pass over the document instead of several. References can be filled in by remembering
    and later modifying the relevant part of the DOM tree.
